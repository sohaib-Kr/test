Protein synthesis occurs through translation and is based on mRNA codons.2 Scientists use recombinant DNA technology to modify codons and develop diverse proteins with potentially enriched activities.3 &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Genetic engineering technologies that enable cloning of any gene found in nature and DNA chemical synthesis have immensely contributed to the protein engineering field. In addition, technological advancements such as x-ray crystallography and computer modeling help researchers design amino acid sequences that fold into precise 3D structures, synthesizing proteins with specific properties.4 &#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For me, this storm took the shape of bullying. While I appeared to handle the daily microaggressions and malicious rumors, inside, I was crumbling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bullying didn’t stop in high school; it followed me into adulthood. Every time I thought I had weathered the storm, another wave of hurtful comments would crash over me, leaving me feeling trapped and powerless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The constant gossip, whispers, and passive-aggressive remarks from others chipped away at my self-worth. I questioned my value, wondering if I deserved the treatment. Was there something inherently wrong with me? Why was I the target of this relentless negativity? These thoughts haunted me for years, leading to a vicious cycle of self-doubt, anxiety, and fear of being judged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At one point, the weight of all these feelings became too much to bear, and I sought counseling. It was in therapy that I first learned about mindfulness, a practice that would transform my life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mindfulness helped me confront the storm I had been carrying inside for years—the shame, hurt, and loss of self-worth brought on by years of bullying and mistreatment. Here’s how this practice helped me heal and reclaim my self-worth, and how you, too, can apply it to your life if you’ve experienced bullying, mistreatment, or any form of emotional harm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#39;my-[120px] w-full&#39;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;div&gt;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&#39;text-[#e1e1e1] leading-[1.9] mb-[50px] mx-[4vw] font-[cardo] text-[1.6vw] d:text-[17px] d:mb-[25px] d:mx-[2vw]&#39;&gt;Gallup surveys have found that a majority of Americans aren’t “engaged” with their jobs, as defined as “those who are involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace.” Almost 18% of employees are in fact “actively disengaged” from their jobs.&#xA;&#xA;Maybe you’re somewhere in that 70% of the working disconnected. Maybe you don’t positively hate your job, but you don’t find it particularly fulfilling either. You don’t feel like your work calls upon your abilities or scratches a certain itch that won’t go away.&#xA;&#xA;Your job doesn’t feel like the kind of work you were meant to do, or that you’d simply like to do.&#xA;&#xA;So you think about doing something really different, and daydream about other possibilities. But the gap between where you are now and where you’d like to be seems huge. You’re not in a situation where you can just up and quit your day job. So how can you carve out an entirely new path for yourself while tethered to your 9-5?&#xA;&#xA;How can you build a bridge between your life now and the life you want?&#xA;&#xA;The answer is moonlighting: working a side project in your spare time until it becomes viable enough to be your full-time gig, or simply offers sufficient satisfaction that you don’t mind that your day job isn’t the end all, be all of your existence.&#xA;&#xA;If you’ve ever considered moonlighting your way to a different life, today we’ll walk you through the 5 fundamental principles of doing so successfully, using short case studies from famous men in the fields of literature, science, and entrepreneurship to illustrate these keys in action.&#xA;&#xA;Whether the moon’s hanging outside your window right now, or you’re reading this at the desk of your so-so job, let’s get right into it. &#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>16 Easy Steps for Planning Your Next Trip</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/planning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#39;my-[120px] w-full&#39;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&#39;text-[#e1e1e1] leading-[1.9] mb-[50px] mx-[4vw] font-[cardo] text-[1.6vw] d:text-[17px] d:mb-[25px] d:mx-[2vw]&#39;&gt;I remember when I started planning my first trip around the world. I had no idea what I was doing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I decided to quit my job and travel the world, I walked into a bookstore and bought Lonely Planet’s Southeast Asia on Shoestring. Buying that guidebook was my first step toward long-term travel. It made the trip seem more real, more tangible. It made it all seem possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While helpful, the book didn’t exactly prepare me for planning a trip around the world. Back then, there weren’t really travel blogs, sharing economy websites, and apps like there are today. I was excited and determined — but I was lost. I had to figure it out as I went, hoping I didn’t miss anything important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trip planning can be a daunting task. Where do you begin? What’s step one? What’s step two? What’s step three?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It’s easy to get overwhelmed, especially when you haven’t done something like this before — and especially considering just how much information there is out there these days. Blogs, social media, and guidebooks have never been more plentiful. There’s a firehose of information out there that can sometimes make the task of planning a trip even more challenging and overwhelming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After a decade of traveling the world, I’ve planned countless trips and vacations for myself, friends, family, and even group tours. In the beginning, it was trial by fire and I learned a lot of lessons the hard way. However, that helped me develop an efficient checklist that ensures I don’t miss anything important during the trip planning process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After all, I don’t want to get to my next destination and then realize I forgot something. And neither do you!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a lot of information on this website (and even more information packed into my book), but one question that comes up frequently is, “Matt, how do I put this all together? How do I plan a trip?”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a continuing effort to help you get out the door and into the world, I’ve created this step-by-step guide on how to plan a trip. It works for any kind of trip — no matter how long you’re going for! Just follow this checklist and you’ll be off in no time!&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Boring Ways to Become More Creative</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/creativity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#39;my-[120px] w-full&#39;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&#39;text-[#e1e1e1] leading-[1.9] mb-[50px] mx-[4vw] font-[cardo] text-[1.6vw] d:text-[17px] d:mb-[25px] d:mx-[2vw]&#39;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;Creativity and crazy. They go together like ginger and beer, aged cheese and fine wine, impressionist painters and lead poisoning. One can hardly think of one without the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Almost by definition, creativity is the opposite of boring. If something is creative, it’s because it triggers some degree of surprise or excitement within us—it reconfigures existence in ways we could not have previously imagined.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Creative people are not boring. Creative work is not boring. Therefore, we assume that the secret to creative success must not be boring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I had a friend in college who wanted to be a famous novelist. After graduation, he bought a one-way ticket to Paris and intentionally became homeless for all of about three weeks, believing he had to suffer romantically to find inspiration for his art. A few years later, I met a guy in a punk band in Boston who insisted that his heroin usage wasn’t an addiction but part of his creative process, because, as he put it, “nothing good was ever written sober.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, sure enough, if we look at history’s greatest creative geniuses, there’s anecdote after anecdote of them being absolutely fucking looney tunes. Igor Stravinsky believed he could only become inspired to write music if he did headstands. In the early days of Apple, Steve Jobs reportedly soaked his feet in the bathroom toilets to clear his mind before meetings. Vincent Van Gogh got in an argument with his flatmate, lopped his own ear off, and—not wanting it to go to waste—gift-wrapped the ear and gave it to his favorite prostitute as a memento.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, “boring” is the last word you would ever use to describe the world’s creative geniuses. And indeed, their work is anything but.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I’m going to argue something different. I’m going to argue that the process of creativity is actually quite boring. And, because it is boring, creativity itself is repeatable. It’s something you and I and anyone else can practice and become good at.1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because while the person and the work may be anything but boring, history and science teach us that the process that generates great work… is totally boring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that’s good news for us.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
