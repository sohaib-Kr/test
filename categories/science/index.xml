Protein synthesis occurs through translation and is based on mRNA codons.2 Scientists use recombinant DNA technology to modify codons and develop diverse proteins with potentially enriched activities.3 &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Genetic engineering technologies that enable cloning of any gene found in nature and DNA chemical synthesis have immensely contributed to the protein engineering field. In addition, technological advancements such as x-ray crystallography and computer modeling help researchers design amino acid sequences that fold into precise 3D structures, synthesizing proteins with specific properties.4 &#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
